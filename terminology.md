# Compiling: 
In formal computer-science lingo, "compiling" typically refers to the process of taking human-readable code and transforming it into machine-readable code.

# Expression:
At its core, an expression is a bit of JavaScript code that produces a value. Statements are the rigid structure that holds our program together, while expressions fill in the details. Statements often have "slots" for expressions. We can put any expression we like into those slots.

1 → produces 1
"hello" → produces "hello"
5 * 10 → produces 50
num > 100 → produces either true or false
isHappy ? "🙂" : "🙁" → produces an emoji
[1, 2, 3].pop() → produces the number 3

# Statement:
A statement is an instruction to the computer to do a particular thing. Statements are the rigid structure that holds our program together, while expressions fill in the details. Statements often have "slots" for expressions. We can put any expression we like into those slots.

# Syntactic Sugar: 
An alternative way of producing the same result, but with a “sweeter” API. Generally something that makes the code a bit nicer to work with.

# Transpiling:
The term "transpiling", by contrast, typically refers to taking one high-level language and transforming it into another high-level language.
