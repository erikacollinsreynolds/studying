// DATA STRUCTURES

// Why data structures?
// - it allows engineers to store their data in optimal formats

/* Stack
- serves as a collection of elements with two principle operations:
  - push: adds an element to the collection
  - pop: removes the last element that was added
- follows the LIFO (last in, first out) principle where the last element in is the first element removed
- think of stack as plates
- other operations:
  - .peek: to see what the top most element is, without removing it
  - .isEmpty: to check if our stack is empty
  - .size: to check how many elements we have there
  - .clear: to completely clean up the stack
*/

/* QUEUE
- serves as a collection of elements that preserves the order at which the elements were inserted
- principle operations are:
  - enqueue: adds an element to the collection
  - dequeue: removes the element that was added the earliest
- follows the FIFI (first in, first out) principle
- think of a queue like a movie theatre line or QUEUE
